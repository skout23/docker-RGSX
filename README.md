# 🎮 Retro Game Sets Xtra (RGSX)

This repository keeps a Docker-friendly wrapper around RGSX so it can run on NAS or server hardware with the official web interface. The container now pulls the upstream project during build, so you benefit from the maintainer’s updates without manually merging hundreds of commits. Head to the Docker section for usage details.

## LISEZ-MOI EN FRANCAIS : https://github.com/RetroGameSets/RGSX/blob/main/README_FR.md

RGSX is a Python application developed using Pygame for graphics, created for the community by RetroGameSets. It is completely free.

The application supports multiple sources like myrient and 1fichier. These sources can be updated frequently.

## ✨ Features

- **Game downloads** : Support for ZIP files and handling of unsupported extensions thanks to the `info.txt` file in each folder (batocera), which automatically extracts if the system doesn't support archives.
  - Downloads require no authentication or account for most sources.
  - Systems marked `(1fichier)` in the name will only be accessible if you provide your 1fichier API key (see below).
- **Download history** : View and re-download previous files.
- **Multi-select downloads** : Mark multiple games in the game list with the key mapped to Clear History (default X) to enqueue several downloads in one batch. Press Confirm to start batch.
- **Control customization** : Remap keyboard or controller keys to your preference with automatic button name detection from EmulationStation (beta).
- **Font size adjustment** : If you find the text too small/too large, you can change it in the menu.
- **Search mode** : Filter games by name for quick navigation with virtual keyboard on controller.
- **Multilingual support** : Interface available in multiple languages. You can choose the language in the menu.
- **Error handling** with informative messages and LOG file.
- **Adaptive interface** : The interface adapts to all resolutions from 800x600 to 4K (not tested beyond 1920x1080).
- **Automatic updates** : the application must be restarted after an update.

### Quick Start (Prebuilt Image)

Pull the latest image from GitHub Container Registry:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/brownster/rgsx-docker:latest
```

Run the container:

```bash
docker run -d --name rgsx \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -v /path/to/your/roms:/roms \
  -v /path/to/your/saves:/saves \
  ghcr.io/brownster/rgsx-docker:latest
```

Access the web UI at `http://localhost:8080`

### Building the Docker Image (Optional)

If you prefer to build from source:

```bash
docker build -t rgsx .
```

### Running with Docker Compose

The easiest way to run the application with Docker is to use Docker Compose. A `docker-compose.yml` file is provided for this purpose.

1.  **Configure the volumes:** Open the `docker-compose.yml` file and edit the `volumes` section to map your local ROMs and saves directories to the container's `/roms` and `/saves` directories.

    ```yaml
    volumes:
      # Point these to your NAS paths
      - /path/to/your/roms:/roms
      - /path/to/your/saves:/saves
    ```

2.  **Start the container:** Run the following command to start the container in the background:

    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

The web UI will be available at `http://<your-docker-host>:8080`.

### Available Tags

- `ghcr.io/brownster/rgsx-docker:latest` - Latest stable release
- `ghcr.io/brownster/rgsx-docker:v1.0.0` - Specific version (recommended for production)

### Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure the Docker container:

| Variable              | Description                               | Default |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| `TZ`                  | Timezone for the container                | `UTC`   |
| `RGSX_MODE`           | Set to `web` to enable the web UI         | `web`   |
| `WEB_PORT`            | Port for the web UI                       | `8080`  |
| `ONEFICHIER_API_KEY`  | Pre-seed 1fichier API key                 | -       |
| `RGSX_DISABLE_UPDATER`| Disable automatic updates                 | `1`     |

To run the container as a specific user/group, set the `user:` field in your compose file.

## 🌐 Web UI

RGSX now includes a web-based user interface that allows you to manage your retro game collection from a web browser.

### Features

-   **Browse platforms and games:** View your entire collection of platforms and games.
-   **Download games:** Start and monitor game downloads directly from the web UI.
-   **View download history:** See a list of all your downloaded games.
-   **Search:** Quickly find games across all your platforms.
-   **1Fichier API Key:** Configure your 1Fichier API key.

### Accessing the Web UI

When running RGSX with Docker, the web UI is enabled by default. You can access it at:

`http://<your-docker-host>:8080`


## 🏁 First startup
---
> ## IMPORTANT
> If you have a 1Fichier API key, you must enter it in  
> `/saves/ports/rgsx/1FichierAPI.txt`  
> if you want to download from 1Fichier links.
---

- Launch RGSX from ports on batocera, from Windows on Retrobat.
- On first launch, the application will automatically import the control configuration from EmulationStation if available.
- Configure controls if necessary. They can be reconfigured via the pause menu later.
- Delete the `/saves/ports/rgsx/controls.json` file in case of problems then restart the application.
- The application will then automatically download all necessary data.

INFO: for retrobat on first launch, the application will download Python in the /system/tools/python folder which is necessary to run the application. The file is about 50MB and downloads quite quickly but there is no visual feedback on screen, which will remain frozen on the RGSX loading for a few seconds.
---

## 🕹️ Usage

### Menu navigation

- Use the directional keys (D-Pad, keyboard arrows) to navigate between platforms, games and options.
- Press the key configured as start (default, **P** or Start button on controller) to open the pause menu.
- From the pause menu, access history, control help (control display changes depending on which menu you're in) or reconfiguration of keys, languages, font size.
- You can also, from the menu, regenerate the cache of the systems/games/images list to be sure to have the latest updates.

---

### Download

- Select a platform, then a game.
- Press the confirm key (default, **Enter** or **A** button) to start the download.
- Optional: Press the key mapped to Clear History (default **X**) on several games to toggle multi-selection ([X] marker). Then press Confirm to launch a sequential batch download.
- Follow the progress in the `HISTORY` menu.

---

### Control customization

- In the pause menu, select **Reconfigure controls**.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to map each action by holding the key or button for 3 seconds.
- Button names are automatically displayed according to your controller (A, B, X, Y, LB, RB, LT, RT, etc.).
- The configuration is compatible with all controllers supported by EmulationStation.

---

### History

- Access download history via the pause menu or by pressing the history key (default, **H**).
- Select a game to re-download it if necessary in case of error or cancellation.
- Clear all history via the **CLEAR** button in the history menu. Games are not deleted, only the list.
- Cancel a download with the **BACK** button.

---

### Logs

Logs are saved in `roms/ports/RGSX/logs/RGSX.log` on batocera and on Retrobat to diagnose problems and should be shared for any support.
